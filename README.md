# Devcade Documentation

On this website you can find any documentation you need for working with the Devcade project, whether you want to make a game, leverage the API, or build your own machine.

## What is Devcade?
Devcade is a fully custom arcade machine made by members at RIT's Computer Science House. Devcade is an arcade built for developers, by developers. The arcade cabinet, software, and games for Devcade were all built by CSHers in the 2022 Fall semester.

The arcade cabinet was first shown off at the 2022 Rochester Makerfaire. This cabinet is the first of its kind, but hopefully not the last.
